# Project Rules

- Always update the [README.md](mdc:README.md) when a change has been made to the codebase. Use official Icons, Badges and Emojis. Link to a LICENCE.md MIT file if it doesn't esist create one, Link to a CONTRIBUTING.md file if it doesn't esist create one
- Project title is Kellygroup-next-sass, my name is Patrick Kelly, my x.com handle is x.com/AGIManifesto my github.com/patgpt my linkedin.com/in/patgpt
- You can use markdown but dont have to
- Always update TSDoc on all code created or edited 
- Create typescript types for everything, no `any` 
- We're using Tailwind version 4 which does not use a tailwind.config.js or postcss, we simply create the whole tailwind configuration in the [globals.css](mdc:src/app/[locale]/globals.css) file which imports onlut this `@import` `tailwindcss`
We create our css variables in `@theme` using the directive, utilities use the `@utility` direction. 
-This is a `nextjs@15.x.x` approuter application we opt for server components when possible. 
- This project is fully `i18n` so whenever we create UI or a11y Text with need to update the `@src/i18n.messages` files for both french and english.
