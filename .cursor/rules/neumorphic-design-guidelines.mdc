NEUMORPHIC DESIGN SYSTEM GUIDELINES
Neumorphism (also known as Soft UI) is a design style that blends skeuomorphism (mimicking real-world textures and depth) with flat design’s minimalism. It leverages subtle shadows, highlights, and gently raised or recessed surfaces to create a tactile, modern aesthetic. These guidelines are designed for a design system, providing an AI with all necessary rules to implement Neumorphic UI/UX consistently, balancing aesthetics, usability, accessibility, and performance.
1. INTRODUCTION
Neumorphism creates a soft, extruded appearance for UI elements, suggesting they are part of the background surface. It’s ideal for calm, refined interfaces that emphasize depth and interactivity. Key traits include:
Subtle shadows and highlights for perceived depth.
A monochromatic or minimal color palette.
Smooth transitions and gentle animations.
Purpose: These guidelines ensure the AI applies Neumorphic design systematically, maintaining consistency across components, states, and modes while addressing practical considerations.
2. CORE PRINCIPLES
These principles are non-negotiable and define the Neumorphic aesthetic:
2.1 Subtlety
Use delicate gradients of shadow and highlight.
Avoid stark contrasts or heavily pronounced shadows.
Ensure smooth transitions for a gentle, understated look.
2.2 Perceived Depth via Shadows and Highlights
Apply a dual-shadow approach:
Light Shadow (Highlight): Top-left edge, e.g., #FFFFFF at 20% opacity, 5px blur.
Dark Shadow (Depth): Bottom-right edge, e.g., #D1D1D1 at 20% opacity, 5px blur.
For recessed elements (e.g., input fields), reverse shadow placement: dark top-left, light bottom-right.
2.3 Monochromatic or Minimal Color Palette
Use uniform hues (e.g., #F0F0F0 for light mode, #333333 for dark mode).
Distinguish elements via shadow/highlight variations, not bold colors.
If branding requires an accent, choose a muted hue (e.g., #A3BFFA) with minimal saturation.
3. COMPONENTS
Apply these rules to style foundational UI elements consistently, reflecting states like default, hover, pressed, and disabled.
3.1 Buttons
Default: Raised look with light top-left shadow (#FFFFFF, 5px blur) and dark bottom-right shadow (#D1D1D1, 5px blur).
Pressed: Invert shadows (dark top-left, light bottom-right) to appear depressed.
Hover/Focus: Increase brightness by 10% or add a faint inner glow (e.g., #FFFFFF, 2px blur).
Disabled: Reduce shadow opacity to 10% and element opacity to 60%.
3.2 Cards
Surface: Match background hue with a slight shift (e.g., #F5F5F5 on #F0F0F0).
Depth: Deeper edge shadow (e.g., #D1D1D1, 10px blur) for layering.
Corners: Rounded, 8px radius minimum.
3.3 Toggles & Switches
Off State: Recessed with dark top-left shadow, light bottom-right shadow.
On State: Raised with standard Neumorphic shadows (light top-left, dark bottom-right).
Transition: Smooth animation, 150–250ms, eased timing.
3.4 Input Fields
Default: Recessed style (dark top-left, light bottom-right shadows).
Focus: Add a subtle glow (e.g., #A3BFFA, 3px blur) around edges.
Disabled: Reduce shadow opacity to 10% and contrast by 20%.
3.5 Text and Icons
Text: Use legible typography (e.g., 16px, medium weight) with WCAG-compliant contrast.
Icons: Clear, bold outlines; supplement shadows with shape for visibility.
4. UX & INTERACTION
Ensure interactions are intuitive and tactile with clear visual feedback.
4.1 State Clarity
Define distinct visuals for:
Default: Subtle elevation.
Hover: Brighten or glow.
Pressed: Shadow inversion.
Disabled: Faded appearance.
4.2 Animation
Use short, eased transitions (150–250ms) for state changes (e.g., button press, toggle flip).
Keep animations subtle to preserve minimalism.
4.3 Hover Effects
Increase brightness by 10% or add a mild inner glow.
Avoid drastic shifts that break the soft aesthetic.
4.4 Pressed Feedback
Invert shadows or reduce luminosity by 10% to show depression.
Ensure noticeable yet gentle feedback.
5. UI ELEMENT STATES
Apply these treatments to all interactive elements:
Default: Light top-left shadow, dark bottom-right shadow.
Hover: Brighten by 10% or add glow (e.g., #FFFFFF, 2px blur).
Active/Pressed: Reverse shadows (dark top-left, light bottom-right).
Disabled: Reduce shadow opacity to 10%, element opacity to 60%.
6. ACCESSIBILITY (A11Y)
Neumorphism’s subtle contrasts require strict accessibility rules:
6.1 Contrast
Meet WCAG 2.1 AA:
4.5:1 for normal text (e.g., #333333 on #F0F0F0).
3:1 for large text (18pt+ or 14pt bold).
Validate with contrast-checking tools.
6.2 Focus Indicators
Add a 2px solid ring (e.g., #A3BFFA) for keyboard navigation.
Ensure focus differs from hover (e.g., stronger outline).
6.3 Color Blindness & Low Vision
Use shape and depth (e.g., shadow direction) over color alone.
Supplement shadows with icons or text labels.
6.4 Testing
Conduct user testing with diverse groups to confirm usability.
7. CONSISTENCY
Maintain a cohesive look across the system:
7.1 Shadow Depth
Standardize: Light shadow (#FFFFFF, 20% opacity, 5px blur), dark shadow (#D1D1D1, 20% opacity, 5px blur).
Define tokens (e.g., shadow-light, shadow-dark).
7.2 Corner Radius
Use 8px minimum radius for all elements.
7.3 Color Palette
Limit to:
Background: #F0F0F0 (light), #333333 (dark).
Surface: #F5F5F5 (light), #3C3C3C (dark).
Accent: Optional muted hue (e.g., #A3BFFA).
7.4 Typography
Use consistent styles (e.g., 16px regular, 14px bold) with adequate contrast.
8. SHADOWS IN LIGHT VS. DARK VARIATIONS
Adjust shadows for mode-specific contrast:
8.1 Light Mode
Background: #F0F0F0.
Shadows: #FFFFFF (highlight), #D1D1D1 (depth), both 20% opacity, 5px blur.
Highlights: Brighter top-left edges.
8.2 Dark Mode
Background: #333333.
Shadows: #555555 (highlight), #000000 (depth), both 25% opacity, 5px blur.
Contrast: Slightly stronger than light mode, still subtle.
9. BACKGROUND & SURFACE APPEARANCE
Background: Uniform or faint gradient (e.g., #F0F0F0 to #E8ECEF).
Surfaces: Shift brightness by 5% from background (e.g., #F5F5F5).
Borders: Avoid; use shadows/highlights for definition.
10. PRACTICAL TIPS & LIMITATIONS
10.1 Avoid Overuse
Limit shadow layers to 2 per element to prevent haziness.
10.2 Scale Appropriately
Ensure elements are ≥40x40px to showcase shadows effectively.
10.3 Performance
Optimize shadows with CSS (e.g., box-shadow) and avoid excessive layering.
Use will-change: transform for smoother animations.
11. FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS
Enhance the system with these optional features:
11.1 Micro-Interactions
Shift shadows subtly on hover (e.g., +1px offset) to mimic light movement.
11.2 Dynamic Theming
Adapt accent colors (e.g., #A3BFFA) while preserving contrast.
11.3 Advanced Accessibility
Use media queries:
prefers-reduced-motion: Disable animations.
prefers-contrast: Increase shadow opacity to 30%.
11.4 Textures
Add subtle grain (e.g., 5% noise) to backgrounds for depth.
11.5 Performance Optimization
Minimize shadow blur radius (≤10px) on low-end devices.
